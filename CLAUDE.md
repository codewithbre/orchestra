# CLAUDE.md - Orchestra

## What this repo is

Orchestra is a monorepo of AI coding agents built on the Task Integrity philosophy. It contains the shared skill definitions, docs, and templates that all agents use, plus the agent packages themselves (`packages/fugue`, `packages/coda`).

This CLAUDE.md is for agents contributing to Orchestra itself. If you are working on a project that has adopted the Orchestra workflow, use that project's CLAUDE.md instead.

## Primary Principle: Task Integrity

Every change to this repo must be a single functional change with:
- A clear intent (what will be different when this is done)
- A clear location (exactly which files change)
- A clear output (what the deliverable looks like)
- A scope that can be verified in one pass

**Do not accept vague tasks.** "Improve the docs" is not a task. "Add a worked example to docs/workflow.md showing a feature request traced through all seven skills" is a task.

## Workflow router

Use this table to decide which skill to invoke before doing any work:

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| Need to scope new work for this repo | `/breakdown` |
| Writing a task document | `/write-task` |
| Verifying task docs are self-contained | `/verify-task` |
| Generating IMPLEMENTATION.md from task docs | `/create-tracker` |
| Implementing a scoped task | `/implement` |
| Writing a PR description | `/create-pr` |
| Posting a retrospective after all tasks merge | `/reprise` |

**Never begin implementation without a task document.** If you don't have one, use `/write-task` first.

## Conventions

### Writing style
- Use plain sentences. No em dashes. No marketing language.
- Prose in docs should read like it was written by a senior engineer explaining a real decision, not a product pitch.
- Code examples should be runnable — no pseudocode unless clearly labeled.

### File naming
- All docs: `kebab-case.md`
- All skill files: `kebab-case.md` matching the skill command name

### Commit format
```
type(scope): short description

Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor
Scope: the file or directory affected (e.g. docs, skills, templates, readme)
```

## Do not

- Do not add dependencies to the repo root — it has no package.json. Dependencies belong inside `packages/*`.
- Do not modify skill files without updating both `skills/` and `~/.claude/commands/` — they must stay in sync.
- Do not write placeholder content — every file either contains real content or does not exist.
- Do not create architecture or design docs without a task document approving the scope first.
- Do not commit directly to main — every change is a PR.
